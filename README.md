# Amazon-Challenge
 Amazon Challenge for Bright Network Internship

This challenge i coded my program to move diagnollay down until it is prvented by a obstacle.
this is checked via a method, if the the next square has a "X" in its array. then it will not move to that square
Therefore after it hits the X. it will move down or right. It will move down if there is no obstacle below it.
 finally it will reach the final point of (9,9)
 If the algorithm cant make it to the end. the code will run if the current position is the same after 3 turns.
 The journy is then tracked via a sequence of moves made.
